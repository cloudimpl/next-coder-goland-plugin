## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Via JetBrains Marketplace (Recommended)**:
    *   Open GoLand.
    *   Go to `Settings/Preferences` > `Plugins`.
    *   Search for "GoLand Polycode Navigator" in the Marketplace tab.
    *   Click `Install` and restart the IDE.

2.  **Manual Installation**:
    *   Download the latest `.zip` release from the [releases page](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template/releases).
    *   Open GoLand.
    *   Go to `Settings/Preferences` > `Plugins`.
    *   Click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon (gear) and select `Install Plugin from Disk...`.
    *   Select the downloaded `.zip` file and restart the IDE.

### Usage

Once installed, the GoLand Polycode Navigator works in the background to enhance your navigation experience.

*   **Contextual Navigation**: When working in a Go file, use standard navigation shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B` for Go to Definition) on elements that have cross-language references. The plugin will intelligently suggest or directly navigate to the corresponding definition in another language.
*   **Polycode Search**: Utilize the enhanced search capabilities to find usages or declarations across your entire polycode project, regardless of the language.

More detailed usage instructions and examples will be provided in future updates.
